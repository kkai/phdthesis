  abstract={We attempted to classify walking on level ground from walking on a stairway
  using a waist acceleration signal. A tri-axial accelerometer was fixed to the subject's
  waist and the three acceleration signals were recorded by a portable data logger at a
  sampling rate of 256 Hz. Eleven healthy, elderly subjects were asked to walk through a
  corridor and up and down a stairway as a single sequence, without any instruction. The
  data were analyzed using a discrete wavelet transform. Walking patterns were classified
  using two parameters; one was the ratio between the power of wavelet coefficients which
  were corresponded to locomotion and total power in the anteroposterior direction (RPA).
  The other was the ratio between root mean square of wavelet coefficients at the
  anteroposterior direction and that at the vertical direction (RAV). Walking up
  stairs could be distinguished by the smallest value in RPA from other walking patterns.
  Walking down stairs could be discriminated from level
  walking using RAV. It was possible to classify the walking pattern using
  acceleration signals in elderly people. }

abstract =   {As the proliferation of pervasive and ubiquitous computing devices
 continues, users will carry more devices. Without the ability for these devices
 to unobtrusively interact with one another, the users attention will be spent o
n coordinating, rather than using, these devices. We present a method to determi
ne if two devices are carried by the same person, by analyzing walking data reco
rded by low-cost MEMS accelerometers using the coherence function, a measure of 
linear correlation in the frequency domain. We also show that these low-cost sen
sors perform similarly to more expensive accelerometers for the frequency range 
of human motion, 0 to 10Hz. We also present results from a large test group illu
strating the algorithms robustness and its ability to withstand real world time 
delays, crucial for wireless technologies like Bluetooth and 802.11. We present 
results that show that our technique is 100% accurate using a sliding window of 
8 seconds of data when the devices are carried in the same location on the body,
 is tolerant to inter-device communication latencies, and requires little commun
ication bandwidth. In addition we present results for when devices are carried o
n different parts of the body.},
