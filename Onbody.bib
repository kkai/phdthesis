abstract={Abstract. Mobile information appliances are increasingly used in numerous
different situations and locations, setting new requirements to their interaction
methods. When the user's situation, place or activity changes, the functionality
of the device should adapt to these changes. In this work we propose a layered
real-time architecture for this kind of context-aware adaptation based on
redundant collections of low-level sensors. Two kinds of sensors are
distinguished: physical and logical sensors, which give cues from environment
parameters and host information. A prototype board that consists of eight
sensors was built for experimentation. The contexts are derived from cues using
real-time recognition software, which was constructed after experiments with
Kohonen's Self-Organizing Maps and its variants. A personal digital assistant
(PDA) and a mobile phone were used with the prototype to demonstrate
situational awareness. On the PDA font size and backlight were changed
depending on the demonstrated contexts while in mobile phone the active user
profile was changed. The experiments have shown that it is feasible to
recognize contexts using sensors and that context information can be used to
create new interaction metaphors.}

Using the measured acceleration data, the proposed method can detect forward steps and classify the steps as: "level ground", "up", and "down". The objective of the detection is to count steps for estimating the current position by dead-reckoning using heading measurements. The capability in detecting "up/down" steps can be used to correct estimated position errors. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by experiments on six persons.},

abstract =   {Rehabilitation treatment may be improved by objective analysis of activities of daily living. For this reason, the feasibility of distinguishing several static and dynamic activities (standing, sitting, lying, walking, ascending stairs, descending stairs, cycling) using a small set of two or three uniaxial accelerometers mounted on the body was investigated. The accelerometer signals can be measured with a portable data acquisition system, which potentially makes it possible to perform online detection of static and dynamic activities in the home environment. However, the procedures described in this paper have yet to be evaluated in the home environment. Experiments were conducted on ten healthy subjects, with accelerometers mounted on several positions and orientations on the body, performing static and dynamic activities according to a fixed protocol. Specifically, accelerometers on the sternum and thigh were evaluated. These accelerometers were oriented in the sagittal plane, perpendicular to the long axis of the segment (tangential), or along this axis (radial). First, discrimination between the static or dynamic character of activities was investigated. This appeared to be feasible using an rms-detector applied on the signal of one sensor tangentially mounted on the thigh. Second, the distinction between static activities was investigated. Standing, sitting, lying supine, on a side and prone could be distinguished by observing the static signals of two accelerometers, one mounted tangentially on the thigh, and the second mounted radially on the sternum. Third, the distinction between the cyclical dynamic activities walking, stair ascent, stair descent and cycling was investigated. The discriminating potentials of several features of the accelerometer signals were assessed: the mean value, the standard deviation, the cycle time and the morphology. Signal morphology was expressed by the maximal cross-correlation coefficients with template signals for the different dynamic activities. The mean signal values and signal morphology of accelerometers mounted tangentially on the thigh and the sternum appeared to contribute to the discrimination of dynamic activities with varying detection performances. The standard deviation of the signal and the cycle time were primarily related to the speed of the dynamic activities, and did not contribute to the discrimination of the activities. Therefore, discrimination of dynamic activities on the basis of the combined evaluation of the mean signal value and signal morphology is proposed.},

abstract = {This paper describes an orientation-independent method for detecting activities of daily living based on reference coordinate transformation. With the proposed method, a classification model can be trained using data acquired during a specific sensor orientation and applied to other input signals regardless of the orientation of the device. The technique is validated using activity recognition experiments with four different orientations of a single tri-axial accelerometer placed on the waist of 13 subjects performing a sub-class of activities of daily living. A high subject-independent accuracy of 90.42% has been achieved, reflecting a significant improvement of 11.74% and 16.58%, compared with classification without input transformation and classification with orientation-specific models, respectively.},
